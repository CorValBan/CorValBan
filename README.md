Hi, I'm @CorValBan!

I'm an undergraduate software engineer with a focus on cloud technologies. In my day job, I design, develop, test and deploy APIs using dotNET and nodejs, as well as a range of technologies such as AWS.
I'm also studying part time for a software engineering degree. 

This account is primarily for academic projects and toolkits, with some personal projects as well.
